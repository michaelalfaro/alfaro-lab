# Research

We seek to understand how biodiversity has evolved across the tree of life and we are especially interested in leveraging phyloinformatics and phylogenomics to pursue these questions at scale. Our research spans from understanding broad patterns of diversification to the detailed mechanisms underlying the evolution of complex traits.

Our lab applies a range of approaches including sequence capture of DNA UltraConserved elements, megaphylogeny construction, crowd-sourced high-throughput phenoscaping, comparative phylogenetic analyses, and simulated evolution. We are especially interested in understanding factors that have shaped diversification in ray-finned fishes.

## Color Pattern Evolution and Functional Morphology

A major focus of our research investigates the evolution of color patterns and color reflectance in marine fishes. Working primarily with coral reef systems, we examine how the spectacular diversity of fish color patterns has evolved in response to ecological pressures including predator-prey interactions, intraspecific signaling, and habitat specialization.

Our recent work on butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) has revealed that color pattern diversification has accelerated toward the present, suggesting that rapid evolutionary change in response to speciation pressures has effectively decoupled some aspects of color pattern geometry from ecological predictors. This work raises fundamental questions about the relative roles of selection, drift, and constraint in shaping the evolution of complex visual signals.

We are particularly interested in:

- **Convergent evolution of color patterns**: How similar selective pressures in different lineages give rise to convergent color solutions, including the repeated evolution of blue patches and other chromatic features across marine fish families.

- **Spectral reflectance and function**: Moving beyond pattern geometry to understand how the spectral properties of fish coloration contribute to fitness in different ecological contexts.

- **Quantitative approaches to color analysis**: Developing new computational and statistical methods for analyzing color pattern variation, including function-valued approaches that can capture the full complexity of spectral and spatial color data.

These research directions connect directly to our broader interests in understanding how biodiversity is generated and maintained in species-rich marine ecosystems.

## Phylogenomics and Macroevolution

In addition to our work on color evolution, we continue to explore how the tools developed within the field of macroevolution can be applied to understanding cultural and technological diversification, as well as the deep evolutionary history of major fish lineages.
