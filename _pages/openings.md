# Open positions

If you have strong interests in macroevolution, biodiversity, and phylogenomics and would like to join our team please send me an [email](mailto:michaelalfaro@ucla.edu). 

## Undergraduates

We are looking for new team members to help us with ongoing projects in these areas....

1. An analysis of speciation and extinction in apes. Desired skills: interest/familiarity with ape and hominid evolution, interest/experience with scripting and command line operations.
2. An examination of fish and cepahlopod macroevolution. Desired skills: interest/familiarity with cephalopds, interest/experience with scripting, command line operations, python programming.
3. A study of evolutionary dynamics in complex biomechanical traits.  Desired skills: interest/familiarity in evolutionary dynamics, interest/experience with scripting, command line operations, python programming, C++ programming.
4. Macroevolutionary dynamics of fishes. Desired skills: interst/familiarity with tensorflow and machine learning, interest/experience with python programming, command line operations, scripting, phylogenetics.

In your email please identify which of these projects you are interested in pursuing as well as any relevant expereince you might have. Please also include a CVState briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line.

There are some postdoc scholarship available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/index.html) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm). 

If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office. If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction).
