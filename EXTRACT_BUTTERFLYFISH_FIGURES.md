# Extracting Butterflyfish Color Pattern Figures

## PDF Source
**URL:** https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10170986
**Paper:** "The evolution of color pattern in butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae)" (Alfaro et al. 2019, ICB)

## Steps to Complete Carousel Update

### 1. Download the PDF
- Open: https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10170986
- Download the full PDF to your computer

### 2. Extract Key Figures
**Recommended figures to extract:**
- **Figure 1**: Butterflyfish species showing color pattern diversity (likely showing multiple species with different patterns)
- **Figure 2 or 3**: Phylogenetic tree with color pattern evolution mapping

**Alternative options:**
- Any figure showing the diversity of butterflyfish color patterns
- Phylogenetic analysis results showing pattern evolution over time
- Machine learning classification results (if visually compelling)

### 3. Image Processing
- **Export** figures from PDF at high resolution (300+ DPI)
- **Resize** to 700 × 400 pixels (carousel format)
- **Format**: Save as JPG or PNG
- **File names**: 
  - `butterflyfish_color_diversity.jpg`
  - `butterflyfish_phylo_color.jpg`

### 4. Upload Images
**Place images in:** `~/Dropbox/git/alfaro-lab/images/slider7001400/`

### 5. The carousel code is already updated and ready!
Once you add the images, they will automatically appear in the carousel rotation.

## What's Already Done ✅
- ✅ Carousel indicators updated (added slides 12 and 13)
- ✅ Carousel slides added with proper citations
- ✅ Links to DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icz119
- ✅ Alt text for accessibility

## Test After Adding Images
1. Commit and push the images to git
2. Check the live site: https://michaelalfaro.github.io/alfaro-lab/
3. Verify both new slides appear in the carousel rotation

## Backup Plan
If you can't extract figures easily, you could also use:
- Field photos of colorful butterflyfishes
- Any existing lab images showing fish color diversity
- The key is visual appeal that supports the color evolution research theme!
